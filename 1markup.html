<p>Tags have angle brackets, < and >, and "wrap" around the text to make elements. The frontslash character leans forward: /. Elements can have attributes;
    <span style="color: rebeccapurple;">
        this span has a style attribute
    </span>
    P tags are for paragraphs. Strong and em tags make text <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>, respectively. Likewise, you can use sup and sub tags to make text <sup>superscript</sup>, or <sub>subscript</sub>, or q tags for short <q>qutoes</q>.</p>
    <blockquote>
        you should use blockquote tags for long quotations, <br>
        a br tage for a line break, and an hr tag for a horizontal rule. <br>
        These are known as self-closing, because they don't have a closing tag.
